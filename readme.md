## Reflection Questions

1. How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?

The Figma designs removed the guesswork. It had detail sheet of what colors to apply and extra details for elements. Things like height and width of an image and what font-size to use. When looking at the Figma design sheet I had access everything I could need.  If I had to eye everything it would be much harder. It allowed me to easily know what was flexbox or grid-box container too.

 
2. What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?

 The challenges I encountered while doing this project was initially I didn't know how to use flexbox
 or grid-box container properly. It was only after the testimonial review last Friday that it clicked.
If your elements need space between or need to be centered its either a flexbox or grid-box container.  After that the qr-code challenge wasn't so bad. As for the blogpost card challenge, I didn't really run into issues until I tried getting the blog-card dimensions exact. I did eventually realize the padding and border width affected the dimensions of card. Another issue I ran into was my p tag had extra space  between itself and the blog title. The chrome dev tools helped me figure out the p tag had a 16px margin on by default. Otherwise, everything went well.   


3. How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?

Frontend Mentor has challenges that are ranked from beginner to experts. It removes the trap of doing something you don't have the skills for. I've personally ran into project that I wasn't ready for. 
Frontend mentor not only provides the right amount of challenge, but gives you access to the figma design sheet. Frontend Mentor also provides access to their discord community. if the Figma file and access to the MDN docs isn't enough for you to finish challenge on your own, you go their for help.
